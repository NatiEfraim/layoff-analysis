# layoff-analysis

This is a student project focusing on analyzing layoffs across various companies, industries, and locations using SQL. The repository includes scripts for different skill levels, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Folder Structure

### 1. `beginners`
- SQL basics: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.

### 2. `intermediate`
- Advanced SQL: `HAVING`, `JOINs`, window functions, and aggregations.

### 3. `advanced`
- Complex SQL: triggers, stored procedures, and CTEs.

### 4. `data_cleaning`
- Scripts for cleaning raw data (removing duplicates, handling nulls, etc.).

### 5. `eda`
- Exploratory Data Analysis for trends, patterns, and outliers.

## What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the dataset, focusing on:
- Largest layoffs.
- Layoff trends by percentage and funds raised.
- Highlighting outliers like companies with 100% layoffs.

## Dataset
Columns include:
- `company`, `location`, `industry`, `total_laid_off`, `percentage_laid_off`, `date`, `stage`, `country`, and `funds_raised_millions`.
